# Broken Image Source in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML: using a broken image source (`src`) attribute.  The `bug.html` file shows an example of this error. The `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

The error occurs when the image source specified in the `src` attribute does not exist or is inaccessible.  This results in a broken image icon being displayed instead of the intended image, degrading the user experience and potentially harming accessibility.  This is especially problematic for visually impaired users who rely on alternative text (alt text) that may not always convey the meaning correctly.

**How to reproduce:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
3. Observe the broken image.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected version.

**Solution:**
The solution is to ensure that the `src` attribute points to a valid and accessible image file.

**Key takeaway:**
Always double-check your image sources to prevent broken images, and ensure you provide appropriate alt text for all images.
